This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of lung cancer. It loads medical data, processes features, trains a classification model, and evaluates its accuracy. By automating detection, it aims to assist in early identification and improve patient outcomes.

Specific Explanations

Data Loading & Preprocessing: Gathers lung cancer data and cleans or normalizes it for model input.

Feature Engineering: Selects or constructs relevant features from the dataset to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Training & Evaluation: Trains a classification algorithm (e.g., neural network or other ML model) and tests its performance using metrics like accuracy or F1-score.

Prediction: Uses the trained model to classify new, unseen data, helping to flag high-risk cases for further medical review.
